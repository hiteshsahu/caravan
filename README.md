# Caravan 🐪🐫🛕

> ### Make it easy to spin SLURM Cluster and submit your HPC workloads to it.

![Caravan COver](./img/cover.jpg)

## Purpose
Slurm is powerful but a chore to operate and submit to. 

Caravan make it easy by bundling everything in a single binary that carries a GPU Slurm cluster *inside it*.

Making it a one-liner to bring up, submit jobs, track experiments and rerun workloads.

> Caravan **uses** Slurm — it doesn't replace it. Slurm stays the scheduler;

> Caravan is the control plane and easier developer experience around it.

Its completing project to:
- [squint](https://github.com/hiteshsahu/squint): TUI Dashboard to check workload & squatting GPUs
- [gpu-lens](https://github.com/hiteshsahu/gpu-lens) : Drop-in GPU + scheduler observability for clusters(SLURM+K8)

## ⚡ Prerequisites

📟 Requires **Go 1.22+**

  > choco install golang

  More detail on this [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@hiteshkrsahu/installing-go-on-windows-the-5-minute-guide-and-the-gotchas-nobody-mentions-878eb3ea2277)
  
  **Slurm** will be installed as Container Image

### 🐳 Container engine
Caravan can work with both `Docker` or `Podman`, it auto-detects (`Docker` first, then`Podman`) and uses the matching Compose.

On Podman it uses `podman-compose` if installed, otherwise it will try to use `podman compose`.

You can Force Podman explicitly:

```bash
CARAVAN_ENGINE=podman caravan cluster up
CARAVAN_COMPOSE="podman compose" caravan cluster up
```

On macOS make sure the Podman VM is running first:

```bash
podman machine start
```

Notes
-  Live Slurm support in WSL2 works if you have access to a remote Linux Slurm cluster (via SSH) or a local Slurm installation inside WSL2.
-  DCGM requires machine with NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support and the NVIDIA WSL driver stack.
-  nvidia-smi is only available on Windows and inside WSL2 when using the NVIDIA WSL GPU drivers.

## Start Your Caravan 🐪🐫

**Once you have CLI ready, you can start cluster and submit jobs**

![Caravan Batch](./img/illustration.jpeg)

###  ✨ 1. Using pre compile released Binary (for production)

Quick start with released CLI binary

**On macOS**

```bash
  go install github.com/hiteshsahu/caravan@latest
  caravan
  
  caravan cluster up        # build + start (controller + 2 fake-GPU nodes)
  caravan cluster down      # stop (-v to also wipe volumes)
  caravan cluster status    # container state + sinfo
  caravan submit <script>   # stream a script into sbatch on the controller
```

### 

### ⚙️ 2. Build Locally (for devs)

Quick start with local binary. 

Note: Replace `caravan` with `./caravan` and you can use them for local CLI

📦 **On macOS**

```bash
  go build -o caravan .
  ./caravan
  
  ./caravan cluster up        # build + start (controller + 2 fake-GPU nodes)
  ./caravan cluster down      # stop (-v to also wipe volumes)
  ./caravan cluster status    # container state + sinfo
  ./caravan submit <script>   # stream a script into sbatch on the controller
```


⊞ **On Windows**

**Note:** for PowerShell users: use `./caravan.exe` instead of `./caravan`.

```bash
   go build -o caravan.exe .
   ./caravan.exe --help
  
  ./caravan.exe cluster up        # build + start (controller + 2 fake-GPU nodes)
  ./caravan.exe cluster status    # container state + sinfo
  ./caravan.exe submit workloads/submit_example.sh
  ./caravan.exe cluster down      # stop (-v to also wipe volumes)
```

## How it works

### ▶️ Starting Slurm Cluster 

Writes an embedded Slurm scaffold to 
- MacOS:   `~/.caravan/cluster` 
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.caravan\cluster`

and runs `docker`/`podman compose` against it.

```bash
  ./caravan cluster up
```

You can override scafold to your desired directory by passing `CARAVAN_DIR`

```bash
  # override the scaffold location with `CARAVAN_DIR`
  CARAVAN_DIR=/tmp/caravan/cluster ./caravan cluster up
```


- The two compute nodes advertise `gpu:4` each as **fake, count-only GPUs** 
- The real GPU scheduling, no hardware needed (no `nvidia-smi` telemetry).

### 📋 Checking Cluster Status

Print container state, then `sinfo`

```bash
  # check job status
  ./caravan cluster status
  ```

<summary>Output:</summary>

</details>

### 📥 Submitting a HPC Workload

Create a simple job script (see `workloads/submit_example.sh`) and submit it:

```bash
  # submit the example script
  ./caravan submit workloads/submit_example.sh

```

<details>
<summary>Output:</summary>
  → submitting workloads/submit_example.sh to local Slurm cluster in /Users/hitesh/.caravan/cluster
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  #SBATCH --job-name=caravan-test
  #SBATCH --output=caravan-test.out
  #SBATCH --time=00:01:00
  #SBATCH --ntasks=1

echo "Hello from Caravan job on $(hostname)"
sleep 5

echo "Done"
</details>

---

### 💥 Tear Down Slurm Cluster
Tear down cluster and option to clean mounted volumes as well

```bash  
  ./caravan cluster down      
  ./caravan cluster down  -v  # Also remove disc volumes  
```  

---

## 👨‍💻 Development

###  ⚙️ Install dependencies
```bash
    # Install dependencies
    go mod tidy
```

###  🧪 Build & Test

Tests are run as part of CI itself.

 ```bash  
    # Formatting go file
    gofmt -w . 
    
    # Linting
    go vet ./... 
    
    # recursively compiles all packages
    go build ./...   

```

### ▶️ Run

``` bash
    # Run the Engine
    go run .                 # mock
    
```

```

The cluster definition is embedded with `//go:embed`, so the binary is
self-contained — there's no separate cluster repo to clone. `caravan cluster up`
extracts it and runs it via a `docker`/`podman` `Engine`.

----

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Caravan grows from "runs a cluster" to "runs your work on it."

- **cluster** *(here)* — `up` / `down` / `status`, behind a single `Engine` interface
  implemented by Docker and Podman today; cloud / bare-metal backends later.
- **submit** *(here)* — `caravan submit script.sh` streams the script straight into
  `sbatch` on the controller. `logs` to follow it; recording/rerun next.
- **rerun** — re-launch a past job by id, reproducibly.
- **exp** — group runs into experiments and compare them.

Each new capability sits behind a `Backend` interface (Slurm today), so swapping
the execution target later doesn't touch the CLI above it.
