# Caravan 🐪🐫🛕

> **A CLI for GPU Slurm stand up a cluster and run workloads on it.**

![](./img/cover.jpg)

### Purpose
Slurm is powerful but a chore to operate and submit to. 

Caravan is a single binary that carries a GPU Slurm cluster *inside it* and makes it a one-liner to bring up,
submit jobs to, and (next) track experiments and rerun workloads.

Its completing project to:
- [squint](https://github.com/hiteshsahu/squint) watching the queue and 
- [gpu-lens](https://github.com/hiteshsahu/gpu-lens) watching the GPUs.

> Caravan **uses** Slurm — it doesn't replace it. Slurm stays the scheduler;

> Caravan is the control plane and developer experience around it.

## Quick start

```bash
# Run the built-in CLI directly from source
go run . cluster up

go run . cluster status

go run . cluster down
```

## Cluster up

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.22+**

- ### Container engine

   Caravan works with `Docker` or `Podman`, it auto-detects (`Docker` first, then
  `Podman`) and uses the matching Compose.

  On Podman it prefers `podman-compose` if
  installed, else `podman compose`. Override either:

### 1. Using Released Binary

```bash
go install github.com/hiteshsahu/caravan@latest
```

Setup Slurm cluster:

```bash
# builds the image, starts controller + 2 GPU nodes
caravan cluster up

# container state, then `sinfo`
caravan cluster status

# stop the cluster
caravan cluster down
# stop and wipe state
caravan cluster down -v
```

### Using Podman

Caravan auto-detects `docker` first, then `podman` if available.

Force Podman explicitly:

```bash
CARAVAN_ENGINE=podman caravan cluster up
CARAVAN_COMPOSE="podman compose" caravan cluster up
```

On macOS make sure the Podman VM is running first:

```bash
podman machine start
```

### 2. Using Local Binary


### Build Binary
Build the binary after changes in Go files:

```bash
go build -o caravan .
```

### Start Cluster
Start the cluster from the local binary:

```bash
./caravan cluster up
```

`caravan cluster up` writes an embedded Slurm scaffold to `~/.caravan/cluster` and runs `docker`/`podman compose` against it.

You can override the scaffold location with `CARAVAN_DIR`:

```bash
CARAVAN_DIR=/tmp/caravan/cluster ./caravan cluster up
```

The two compute nodes advertise `gpu:4` each as **fake, count-only GPUs** — real GPU scheduling, no hardware needed (no `nvidia-smi` telemetry).



### **Submit a job**

Create a simple job script (see `examples/submit_example.sh`) and submit it:

```bash
# start the cluster first
./caravan cluster up

# submit the example script
./caravan submit examples/submit_example.sh

```


<details>
<summary>Output:</summary>
  → submitting examples/submit_example.sh to local Slurm cluster in /Users/hitesh/.caravan/cluster
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  #SBATCH --job-name=caravan-test
  #SBATCH --output=caravan-test.out
  #SBATCH --time=00:01:00
  #SBATCH --ntasks=1

echo "Hello from Caravan job on $(hostname)"
sleep 5

echo "Done"
</details>

### **Check Status**

```bash

# check job status
./caravan cluster status

podman exec slurmctld squeue
```

### **Clean up**

```bash  
  ./caravan cluster down       # add -v to also remove volumes  
```

## 👨‍💻 DEVELOP

###  ⚙️ Install dependencies
```bash
    # Install dependencies
    go mod tidy
```

###  🧪 Build & Test

Tests are run as part of CI itself.

 ```bash  
    # Formatting go file
    gofmt -w . 
    
    # Linting
    go vet ./... 
    
    # recursively compiles all packages
    go build ./...   

```

### ▶️ Run

``` bash
    # Run the Engine
    go run .                 # mock
    
```

```

The cluster definition is embedded with `//go:embed`, so the binary is
self-contained — there's no separate cluster repo to clone. `caravan cluster up`
extracts it and runs it via a `docker`/`podman` `Engine`.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Caravan grows from "runs a cluster" to "runs your work on it."

- **cluster** *(here)* — `up` / `down` / `status`, behind a single `Engine` interface
  implemented by Docker and Podman today; cloud / bare-metal backends later.
- **submit** *(here)* — `caravan submit script.sh` streams the script straight into
  `sbatch` on the controller. `logs` to follow it; recording/rerun next.
- **rerun** — re-launch a past job by id, reproducibly.
- **exp** — group runs into experiments and compare them.

Each new capability sits behind a `Backend` interface (Slurm today), so swapping
the execution target later doesn't touch the CLI above it.
